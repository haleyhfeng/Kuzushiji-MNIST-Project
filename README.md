# UCI Math 10 Kaggle Competition

Description: This is the final project for UCI Math 10 course aimed to create regression/classifiers for an in-class Kaggle prediction competition. The datasets are a MNIST replacement, which consists of Japanese characters, and contains the following two: Kuzushiji-MNIST & Kuzushiji-49. Our group mainly focused on the Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset which has 10 classes containing 60,000 training and 10,000 test examples. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on jupyter notebooks using python. One can review it by opening "logistic_regression_malcolmy.ipynb" to review Logistic Regression method, "sgd-&-knn-hf.ipynb" for SGD and kNN method, and "Final Project CNN-Chad.ipynb" for CNN method using jupyter notebook. Our solution for y_pred is in the format of csv and can be review by opening "solutions-chadbreece.csv".
